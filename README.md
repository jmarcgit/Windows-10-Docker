# Windows-10-Docker
Installation guide of Docker for Windows 10 without enabling Hyper-v

Manual steps :

1. Enable the containers feature in Windows 10
	- Start a PowerShell as Administrator
	- Run : Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName containers -Online
	- Reboot the system
  
2. Download the Docker Engine zip file (Docker 19.03.5 here)
	- Start a PowerShell as Administrator
	- Run : Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -OutFile docker-19.03.5.zip https://download.docker.com/components/engine/windows-server/19.03/docker-19.03.5.zip

3. Extract the archive
	- Run : Expand-Archive docker-19.03.5.zip -DestinationPath $Env:ProgramFiles -Force

4. Clean up the zip file
	- Run : Remove-Item -Force docker-19.03.5.zip

5. Add the docker install directory ($env:ProgramFiles\docker) to your PATH environment variable
	- Close the PowerShell window
	- Update the PATH environnement variable in Windows system properties
	- Start a new PowerShell as Administrator
	- Check if the docker command is found (should return an error at this stage). If not check you environment variable and try to fix that.

6. Register the Docker service
	- Run : dockerd --exec-opt isolation=process --register-service
	- Set the Docker Engine service start mode to manual if you don't want to run your containers at anytime
	- Ensure that the Docker Engine service is running

 7. Install docker-compose (1.25.4 here) if required
	- Start a PowerShell as Administrator
	- Run : Invoke-WebRequest "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe" -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $Env:ProgramFiles\Docker\docker-compose.exe
   
 8. Test your installation
	- Start a PowerShell as Administrator again
	- Run : docker run hello-world:nanoserver
	- Docker should download a container image (can take a bit of time depending of the network bandwidth) and display a message
        
Now you can enjoy Docker containers in Windows 10 without the virtualization overhead. The only constraint is that you have to choose a container system version that is matching your OS version. Run winver command in order to check what Windows 10 version you are running. I tested with 1903 and 1909 and I found that Windows 10 version 1909 can run 1903 based containers as well.
